I use this repository to store code I write to demo Tetrix bots for FTC. It is written specifically for small bots that run off of two motors, one on each side of the robot, each with one wheel attached, and a single omniwheel just to keep the whole thing from tipping over. If you use it for a robot with a different configuration, it will probably not work very well.
